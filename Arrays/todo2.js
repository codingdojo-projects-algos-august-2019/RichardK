To Do 2
// Reverse
// Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed. Working ‘in-place’ means that you cannot use a second array – move values within the array that you are given. As always, do not use built-in array functions such as splice().

var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.reverse();


// Rotate
// Implement rotateArr(arr, shiftBy) that accepts array and offset. Shift arr’s values to the right by that amount. ‘Wrap-around’ any values that shift off array’s end to the other side, so that no data is lost. Operate in-place: given ([1,2,3],1), change the array to [3,1,2]. Don’t use built-in functions.
var numbers([1,2,3],1);
numbers.splice(index, 2,3);
numbers.unshift(3);

// Second: allow negative shiftBy (shift L, not R).

// Third: minimize memory usage. With no new array, handle arrays/shiftBys in the millions.

// Fourth: minimize the touches of each element.

Filter Range
Alan is good at breaking secret codes. One method is to eliminate values that lie within a specific known range. Given arr and values min and max, retain only the array values between min and max. Work in-place: return the array you are given, with values in original order. No built-in array functions.
[1,2,3,4,5]
var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
var.splice(index,0,4);

// Concat
// Replicate JavaScript’s concat(). Create a standalone function that accepts two arrays. Return a new array containing the first array’s elements, followed by the second array’s elements. Do not alter the original arrays. Ex.: arrConcat( ['a','b'], [1,2] ) should return new array ['a','b',1,2].
arrConcat( ['a','b'], [1,2] )
var merge = concat.concat([1,2])


Skyline Heights
Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. Let’s say you are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you and extending away. Array [-1,7,3] would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below street level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order. Given [-1,1,1,7,3] return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4]. As always with challenges, do not use built-in array functions such as unshift().
